### Class Lister

## Description
**Class Lister** web application using the Rails framework that is helpful for any student wanting to keep track of their all their current semester classes. A student can see all available classes in alphabetical order, and can choose whatever class they want to add to their list. If a student is not sure what a class is like, they can go to a class's own show page that includes a description of that class.


## Installation
Fork and clone the repository to get started creating your own class list using Class Lister or to add your own ideas to the project.

## How to use?
Using **Class Lister** is very simple. The first page a user will encounter when using the web app is the sign-in page. A return user can sign-in using the email and password that they provided upon signing-up for an account. If a user is new to **Class Lister**, then there is the option of signing-up for an account as a new student or signing-in using Facebook. 

Upon signing-in/signing-up, the user is immediately redirected to their home page where they can see their current class schedule or, if they don't have a schedule, have the option of creating a new class schedule. Students who already have a class schedule have the option of editing or deleting their current schedule.

Upon creating a new schedule or editing a current schedule, a user can see a full list of available classes to choose from. If a student is not sure what a course is like, the user can click on the course to be directed to a course's show page where they can read a description of the course before deciding to add it to their class list.
